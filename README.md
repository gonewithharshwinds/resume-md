## PROJECTS

- **Project Smart Radio Telescope (SmART)** (The Astronomy Club Manipal)
    - A smart radio telescope (SmART) with DSP, ML and AI based capabilities to perform with better accuracy than manual radio telescope; powered with star tracker, and barn-door tracker.
    - PCB designed using KiCAD and TinkerCAD. Python based system implementation.
- **Star Tracker Project** (The Astronomy Club Manipal)
    - Working towards development of a star tracker program which will later be equipped to the Radio Telescope (under development) for better results while studying.
    - An affordable automatic control upgrade for telescopes with any mount method deployed. Developing with Python with Rasp Pi module.

## RESEARCH
- **ALINA** - Advanced Linear Integrator Neural Assembly (Comprehensive Microchip-on-Neuron Integrating Interface)[Oct 2021 - present]
  - Interfacing Assembly Unit for integrating microchip on a human neuron cell.
  - In layman terms, attachment of a virus is achieved when specific proteins on the viral capsid or viral envelope bind to specific proteins called receptor proteins on the cell membrane of the target cell. How this can be implemented artificially is what I am working on.
- **Time Efficient Data Storage Model & Algorithms for Bio-Computers** [Aug 2021 - present]
  - Model depicting time efficient implementation of organic biomolecules for storage.
  - Research on implementation of non-binary base system at molecular level as a way to improve readability. 
## INTERESTED IN
- **Haptic Holographic Technology** - Holograms with Touch Sensation.
  - Currently, these haptic feedbacks from interactive holograms developed by various firms, such as Asukanet or in colleges/ universities such as Glasgow University use sound waves technology. Some day soon, I wish to make usage of more effective methods to better the haptic feedback received when interacting with the holographic projections.
